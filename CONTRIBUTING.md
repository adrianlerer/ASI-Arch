# Contributing to ASI-Arch Meta

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ASI-Arch Meta-Agent system! This project implements Rich Sutton's Oak Architecture principles to create a nursery of evolutionary and improvable AI agents.

## üéØ Project Vision

We're building an ecosystem where AI agents continuously improve through experience, develop open abstractions, and achieve general intelligence through runtime learning. Every contribution helps advance this vision.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Git
- Basic understanding of TypeScript
- Familiarity with AI/ML concepts (helpful but not required)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/asi-arch-meta
   cd asi-arch-meta
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Start Development**

   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project follows Oak Architecture principles:

- **Options**: Policies with termination conditions
- **Knowledge**: Transition models and predictions
- **Subproblems**: Feature achievement challenges
- **Evolution**: Continuous improvement through the 8-step loop

### Key Directories

- `src/`: Core TypeScript interfaces and implementations
- `meta/`: Oak Architecture specific components
- `meta/adapters/`: External agent integrations
- `meta/evolution/`: Evolutionary algorithms
- `tests/`: Test suites

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Use integration tests for evolutionary loops
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for >80% code coverage

#### Documentation

- Document APIs with JSDoc comments
- Include usage examples in code comments
- Update CHANGELOG.md for releases

## üß¨ Working with Evolution

### Adding New Evolutionary Operators

1. **Implement the Interface**
   ```typescript
   import { IEvolutionaryOperator } from '../interfaces/IMetaAgent';
   
   export class MyOperator implements IEvolutionaryOperator {
     async mutate(agent: IMetaAgent): Promise<IMetaAgent> {
       // Your mutation logic
     }
     
     async evaluate(agent: IMetaAgent): Promise<number> {
       // Your fitness evaluation
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Tests**
   ```typescript
   describe('MyOperator', () => {
     it('should improve agent fitness', async () => {
       // Test implementation
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Register in Evolution Loop**
   ```typescript
   // In meta/evolution/loop.ts
   import { MyOperator } from './operators/MyOperator';
   ```

### Creating Agent Adapters

1. **Implement IMetaAgent Interface**
   ```typescript
   export class MyAgentAdapter implements IMetaAgent {
     // Implement all required methods
     async learnPoliciesAndValues(): Promise<void> {
       // Your implementation
     }
     // ... other methods
   }
   ```

2. **Add Configuration Schema**
   ```typescript
   export interface MyAgentConfig extends IAgentConfig {
     mySpecificParam: string;
     anotherParam: number;
   }
   ```

3. **Write Integration Tests**
   ```typescript
   describe('MyAgentAdapter', () => {
     it('completes Oak Architecture cycle', async () => {
       // Test the 8-step loop
     });
   });
   ```
